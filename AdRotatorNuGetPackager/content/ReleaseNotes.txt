Release items
-------------

	* All V1 providers for each platform are now fully supported (Note AdDuplex and AdMob implementations updated)

	* Now with 20% even MORE random! :D
	
Known Issues
------------

	* Known issue with AdDuplex miss-reporting failed ads.  Ads still display but reported as failures.  We've raised it with AdDuplex.
	* InMobi seems to function normally but their control keeps throwing errors on all platforms???
