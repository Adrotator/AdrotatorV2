Release items
-------------

	* All V1 providers for each platform are now fully supported (Note AdDuplex and AdMob implementations updated)
	* Fixed AdMob updated implementation for WP8 (WP7 has now been retired by Google, the control now ceases to function and crashes apps, so we have de-supported it)
	* Supports the new AdMob AdUnit ID format (make sure you update your AdUnits)
	* WP7 platform re-introduced following requests
	* Supports multiple configuration files within projects for multiple ads
	* All static references now removed to allow for multiple use.  Note if you are sharing ads across pages we recommend using a single UserControl.
	* Fixed Issues with AdRefreshRate and IsTest properties
	* AutoStart and Manual start tested thoroughly
	* Now with 20% even MORE random! :D
	
Known Issues
------------

	* Known issue with AdDuplex miss-reporting failed ads.  Ads still display but reported as failures.  We've raised it with AdDuplex.
	* InMobi seems to function normally but their control keeps throwing errors on all platforms???
