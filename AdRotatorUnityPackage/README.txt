Thanks for your interest in our free Unity plugin

The main aim of the plug in is to give you easier access to the configuration and placement of Ads in your game from Unity without having to revisit the project constantly

The plugin and install instructions can be found here - http://getadrotator.com/adrotator-v2-0-1-release-plus-updated-unity-editor-plugin/
Also you can get the plugin directly here from our releases page - https://github.com/Adrotator/AdrotatorV2/releases/download/2.0.1/AdRotatorUnitySDK.unitypackage

*Note, we still recommend hosting your AdRotator config file on the web to give you better control and flexibility for managing your ads

Good luck in your journey and if you have any queries or issues, then just create a new issue here on GitHub and we will be happy to help.
